# ♟️ Chess Board Project  

> A beginner-friendly chess board implementation, starting with structure and expanding to a fully interactive game.  

## 📌 Overview
A simple chess board project with all pieces placed in their correct starting positions.  
This project currently focuses on building the structure of the board and will be enhanced with styling and interactivity in future updates.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- HTML  
*(CSS and JavaScript will be added in upcoming versions)*

## 🚀 Features
- 8x8 chess board layout  
- All chess pieces positioned correctly  
- Base implementation without external styling or scripting

## 📅 Progress

### Day 1 – Initial Layout
- Started the project and set up the basic HTML file.  
- Created the outline of the chess board using the `<table>` element.  
- Defined a fixed width and height for the board area to maintain square proportions.  
- Ensured the structure could support an 8×8 grid layout.  

### Day 2 – Rows & Columns
- Added 8 rows and 8 columns to represent the 64 squares of the chess board.  
- Structured each square using `<tr>` for rows and `<td>` for columns.  
- Verified alignment so the board looks like a proper grid.  
- Checked that the table cells are evenly spaced to keep the chessboard uniform.  

### Day 3 – Adding Chess Pieces
- Inserted all chess pieces in their standard starting positions.  
- Used appropriate symbols/letters (♙♘♗♖♕♔ for White and ♟♞♝♜♛♚ for Black).  
- Placed pawns on the second and seventh rows.  
- Positioned rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings on the first and last rows.  
- Ensured both Black and White sides are mirrored correctly. 

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Add CSS for styling the board and pieces  
- Introduce JavaScript for interactivity (piece movement, game rules)  
- Expand towards a fully playable chess game
